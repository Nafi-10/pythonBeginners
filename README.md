Machine Learning Journey | Started: July 20, 2025
Welcome to my personal Machine Learning learning repository!

This marks the beginning of my self-driven journey into Machine Learning — starting from the basics and gradually progressing to advanced topics. I’ve taken on this challenge independently, without guidance from a course instructor. Instead, I’ll be learning through YouTube tutorials and the support of ChatGPT.

This repository will serve as a structured record of my learning, practice, and growth in the field of Machine Learning. Stay tuned for regular updates!
