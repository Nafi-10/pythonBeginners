AI vs ML vs DL

Artificial Intelligence (AI):
The broadest field. It refers to machines mimicking human intelligence (reasoning, problem-solving, learning, etc.).

Machine Learning (ML):
A subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data and improve automatically without being explicitly programmed.

Deep Learning (DL):
A subset of ML that uses neural networks with many layers (deep neural networks) to model complex patterns in large datasets (e.g., image, audio, language).

Types of Machine Learning

Supervised Learning

Learns from labeled data (input + correct output).

Goal: Predict output for new inputs.

Unsupervised Learning

Learns from unlabeled data.

Goal: Discover hidden patterns or structures.

Semi-Supervised Learning

Combines a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data.

Reinforcement Learning

Learns by interacting with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties based on actions.

Supervised Learning
Definition: Trains on labeled data.

Goal: Predict or classify.

Types:

Classification (e.g., spam detection, disease diagnosis)

Regression (e.g., predicting house prices, temperature)

Unsupervised Learning
Definition: Learns from unlabeled data.

Goal: Find patterns, groupings, or structure.

Types:

Clustering (e.g., customer segmentation â€” K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering)

Dimensionality Reduction (e.g., PCA, t-SNE)
